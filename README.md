# ChatGPT Ninja Launcher

**Formal**: A discreet, hotkey-activated ChatGPT launcher that runs from the system tray. Designed for focus, speed, and zero clutter â€” this tool gives you instant access to ChatGPT in a Chrome app window that hides when not in use and resumes exactly where you left off.

**Informal**: Launches ChatGPT in a clean Chrome window that doesnâ€™t show on the taskbar. Lives quietly in your system tray. Summon it with a hotkey, hide it instantly with Alt+Tab. Great for multitaskingâ€¦ or, you know, if some teacher walks by. ðŸ˜‰

## Features

- Launches ChatGPT on startup, minimized and hidden from the taskbar
- Keeps your ChatGPT session alive â€” no process termination
- Hotkey activated (`Ctrl + Shift + Space`)* for quick access          _*editable_
- Auto-hides on focus loss or Alt+Tab
- Packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller

   ```

   ```

## Building the Executable

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed app.py
```

The final executable will be available in the `dist/` folder.

- Windows OS
- Google Chrome (installed at default path)
- Python 3.7+

## Dependencies

```
pystray
pillow

## Notes

- This tool uses Chrome in `--app` mode to create a clean, standalone-like window for ChatGPT.
- No session data is lost; the Chrome instance remains running in the background.
- For best results, pin the hotkey app to your startup folder or configure it via Task Scheduler for silent launch at boot.
